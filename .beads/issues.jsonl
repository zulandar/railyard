This confused the agent during a todo app test — it saw the database name and incorporated it into its work instead of building the requested in-memory store.\n\nEngines work in git worktrees (`engines/\u003cengineID\u003e/`) which are checkouts of the same repo, so all repo files including `railyard.yaml` are visible to the Claude Code subprocess.\n\nOther Railyard artifacts that could cause similar confusion:\n- `railyard.yaml` — Dolt DB config, track definitions, stall thresholds\n- `engines/` directory — other engine worktrees (shouldn't be visible, already gitignored?)\n- `.beads/` directory — issue tracking data\n\n## Approach Options\n\n### Option A: .claudeignore in worktree (preferred)\nClaude Code respects `.claudeignore` files (same format as `.gitignore`). Before spawning the agent, the engine could write a `.claudeignore` into the worktree that excludes Railyard files:\n```\nrailyard.yaml\n.beads/\nengines/\n```\nThis is the cleanest solution — the agent never sees the files at all.\n\nImplementation: In `EnsureWorktree()` or `SpawnAgent()` in `internal/engine/git.go` or `internal/engine/subprocess.go`, write the `.claudeignore` file before launching claude.\n\n### Option B: System prompt instruction\nAdd a line to `writeInstructions()` in `internal/engine/context.go` telling the agent to ignore `railyard.yaml`. Less robust — agents can still stumble on it during file searches.\n\n### Option C: Both\nWrite `.claudeignore` AND mention it in the prompt for belt-and-suspenders safety.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Engine agents cannot see or search `railyard.yaml` during their work\n- [ ] `.claudeignore` is written to the worktree before the Claude Code subprocess starts\n- [ ] Excluded files: `railyard.yaml`, `.beads/`, `engines/`\n- [ ] The `.claudeignore` is not committed to git (it lives only in the worktree)\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass\n- [ ] Verify by checking that `buildCommand()` in subprocess.go runs after the ignore file is in place","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T21:49:16Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-16T22:14:18Z","closed_at":"2026-02-16T22:14:18Z","close_reason":"Implemented .claudeignore in worktrees, fixed stall re-claim loop, added engine restart to yardmaster/dispatch prompts"}

FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED inside a transaction, but Dolt does not fully support row-level SKIP LOCKED (noted in the code comment on line 17). Dolt falls back to transaction serialization, which means concurrent claims on the same car conflict. The losing transaction gets Error 1213, which is a retryable error — Dolt even says \"try restarting transaction\" in the message — but the code does not retry.\n\n## Fix\nWrap the db.Transaction() call in ClaimCar() in a retry loop (2-3 attempts) with a short random backoff between retries. On Error 1213 (or any MySQL deadlock/serialization error), retry the full transaction. On other errors, return immediately.\n\nThis is a standard pattern for databases with optimistic concurrency control.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] ClaimCar retries on serialization failure (Error 1213) up to 3 times\n- [ ] Backoff between retries is short and randomized (e.g., 50-200ms jitter) to avoid thundering herd\n- [ ] Non-retryable errors still return immediately\n- [ ] After max retries exhausted, return the last error\n- [ ] Add a test that verifies the retry logic (can mock/simulate the error)\n- [ ] Log a warning on retry so it's visible in engine output\n- [ ] Existing ClaimCar tests still pass","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-17T02:11:51Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-17T02:15:42Z","closed_at":"2026-02-17T02:15:42Z","close_reason":"Added retry loop with jittered backoff (50-200ms) to ClaimCar for Dolt serialization failures (Error 1213).

{"id":"railyard-c6d","title":"Add draft status for cars to prevent premature engine claiming during planning","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen Dispatch decomposes a request into multiple cars, it creates them one at a time via `ry car create`. Each car is immediately created with `status=open`. If a car has no dependencies (e.g., a foundation task), an engine can claim it instantly — before Dispatch has finished creating the rest of the plan, setting up dependencies, or adjusting priorities.\n\nThis causes problems:\n- Engine starts work before the full dependency chain is in place\n- If Dispatch adds a dependency AFTER an engine already claimed the car, the dependency is meaningless\n- Engine may produce code that conflicts with the plan Dispatch hasn't finished creating\n- Race condition: engine claims car → Dispatch adds dep → dep is ignored because car is already claimed\n\n## Solution: Add a `draft` status\n\nCars should be created in `draft` status instead of `open`. Dispatch creates all cars, sets all dependencies, then explicitly publishes them to `open` when the plan is complete.\n\n### Flow\n1. Dispatch creates cars → all start as `status=draft`\n2. Dispatch sets dependencies between cars\n3. Dispatch reviews the plan with the user (if interactive)\n4. Dispatch publishes: `ry car publish \u003cepic-id\u003e` (or `ry car update \u003cid\u003e --status open`)\n5. NOW engines can claim them\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Car creation (`internal/car/car.go`)\n- Change default status from `open` to `draft` in `Create()`\n- OR add a `--draft` flag that Dispatch uses (keep backward compat for manual `ry car create`)\n\n#### 2. ClaimCar and ReadyCars queries\n- Already filter on `status=open` — draft cars are automatically excluded, no changes needed\n\n#### 3. Add `ry car publish` command (`cmd/ry/car.go`)\n- Transitions a car (or all children of an epic) from `draft` to `open`\n- `ry car publish \u003ccar-id\u003e` — publish single car\n- `ry car publish \u003cepic-id\u003e --recursive` — publish epic and all draft children\n- Only transitions `draft` → `open`, not other statuses\n\n#### 4. Dispatch prompt (`internal/dispatch/prompt.go`)\n- Update workflow to create cars as draft\n- Add publish step after all cars and deps are set up\n- Show `ry car publish` in available commands\n\n#### 5. Car model (`internal/models/car.go`)\n- Document `draft` as a valid status in the model comments\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Cars created by Dispatch start in `draft` status\n- [ ] `ry car ready` does not show draft cars\n- [ ] Engines cannot claim draft cars (ClaimCar already filters on open)\n- [ ] `ry car publish \u003cid\u003e` transitions draft → open\n- [ ] `ry car publish \u003cepic-id\u003e --recursive` publishes epic and children\n- [ ] `ry car list --status draft` shows unpublished cars\n- [ ] Manual `ry car create` still defaults to open (or has `--draft` flag)\n- [ ] Dispatch prompt updated with publish workflow\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-17T00:58:14Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-17T01:13:43Z","closed_at":"2026-02-17T01:13:43Z","close_reason":"Added draft status as default for new cars.

The worktree may have:\n\n1. Dirty working tree from the previous car's uncommitted changes\n2. Stale local 'main' ref that doesn't include recent merges from yardmaster\n3. Leftover branch checkout from the previous car\n\n## Affected Code\n\n- internal/engine/git.go: EnsureWorktree() creates worktree once at engine start with --detach, but is a no-op on reuse (line 18: just returns existing dir)\n- internal/engine/git.go: CreateBranch() does 'git checkout -b \u003cbranch\u003e main' without any prior cleanup (line 102)\n- cmd/ry/engine.go: daemon loop calls CreateBranch directly after claiming car (line 236) with no fetch/clean step\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\nAdd a ResetWorktree(repoDir, engineID) function (or modify the pre-branch flow) that runs before CreateBranch on each new car:\n\nOption A (clean reset - preferred):\n  1. git fetch origin (update refs)\n  2. git checkout --detach HEAD (detach from any branch)\n  3. git clean -fd (remove untracked files)\n  4. git reset --hard origin/main (reset to latest main)\n  Then CreateBranch proceeds normally from the now-clean, up-to-date state.\n\nOption B (nuke and recreate):\n  1. RemoveWorktree(repoDir, engineID)\n  2. EnsureWorktree(repoDir, engineID) (creates fresh worktree)\n  Simpler but slower — removes/recreates the whole worktree each cycle.\n\nEither way, the key is: the worktree MUST be in a clean state at origin/main before branching for a new car.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-20T12:43:10Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-20T12:46:39Z","closed_at":"2026-02-20T12:46:39Z","close_reason":"Added ResetWorktree() function to internal/engine/git.go that runs git fetch, detach, clean, and reset --hard before each new car.

{"id":"railyard-ejl","title":"Embed cocoindex Python scripts and migrations in ry binary","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen `ry cocoindex init` runs on a machine with only the standalone `ry` binary (no source tree), `runMigrations()` fails because `cocoindex/migrate.py` doesn't exist at the relative path. Same issue affects `mcp_server.py`, `main.py`, `config.py`, `overlay.py`, and `build_all.py` which are referenced by engine worktree configs.\n\nError: `cocoindex/.venv/bin/python: can't open file 'cocoindex/migrate.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`\n\n## Solution\n\nApply the same `//go:embed` pattern used for `requirements.txt` and docker files. Embed all runtime Python files + migration SQL into the `ry` binary and write them to `cocoindex/` on demand.\n\n### Files to embed (runtime only, skip *_test.py)\n\n- `cocoindex/__init__.py`\n- `cocoindex/migrate.py`\n- `cocoindex/config.py`\n- `cocoindex/main.py`\n- `cocoindex/build_all.py`\n- `cocoindex/overlay.py`\n- `cocoindex/mcp_server.py`\n- `cocoindex/migrations/001_create_overlay_meta.sql`\n\n### Approach\n\n1. Copy the 7 Python files + 1 migration SQL into `cmd/ry/` with `cocoindex_` prefix naming (e.g. `cocoindex_migrate.py`, `cocoindex_migrations_001.sql`)\n2. Add `//go:embed` directives in `cmd/ry/cocoindex.go`\n3.

Add tests: `TestEnsureCocoIndexScripts_CreatesFiles` and `TestEnsureCocoIndexScripts_SkipsExisting`\n\n### No .env changes needed\n\n- `migrate.py` receives `--database-url` as a CLI argument (set by Go code in `runMigrations()`)\n- `mcp_server.py` reads `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_URL` from environment (set by Go code in `WriteMCPConfig()`)\n- `config.py` reads `cocoindex.yaml` relative to `__file__` (works once file is on disk)\n\n### Key detail: migrations subdirectory\n\n`migrate.py` uses `os.path.dirname(__file__)` to locate `migrations/` — so the SQL files must be written to `cocoindex/migrations/` for the path resolution to work correctly.\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `go build ./cmd/ry/` — confirms embeds compile\n2. `go test ./cmd/ry/ -run TestEnsureCocoIndexScripts` — unit tests pass\n3. `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 300s -race` — full test suite passes\n4.

{"id":"railyard-f3r","title":"Stalled engine recovery: teach agents ry engine restart and fix stale car claims","description":"## Problem\n\nMultiple issues around stalled engine recovery:\n\n1. **Dispatch used `ry start` to restart a stalled engine** — this starts the full orchestration (Dispatch + Yardmaster + engines) instead of restarting just one engine. Dispatch doesn't know about `ry engine restart \u003cengine-id\u003e`.\n\n2. **Yardmaster prompt doesn't include `ry engine restart`** — the yardmaster prompt (`internal/yardmaster/prompt.go`) has a 'Stalled Engine' decision rule that marks engines dead and releases cars, but never restarts them. The command exists (`orchestration.RestartEngine()`) but yardmaster doesn't know about it.\n\n3. **Stale car claims create re-claim loops** — when HandleStall marks a car as 'blocked' and the engine is still alive, the engine daemon's `claimOrReclaim()` (`cmd/ry/engine.go:339`) re-claims it because 'blocked' != 'done'/'cancelled'. The engine loops trying to work on a blocked car forever.\n\n4. **Done cars stuck as claimed** — if a car reaches status 'done' but the engine's `current_car` field wasn't cleared (e.g., process died between completion and cleanup), yardmaster should detect and clean this up so the engine can move on.\n\n5. **Dispatch shouldn't manage engines directly** — engine lifecycle is yardmaster's job. Dispatch should know to describe the problem and let yardmaster handle it, or at most use `ry engine restart`.\n\n## Changes Required\n\n### 1. Yardmaster prompt (`internal/yardmaster/prompt.go`)\n- Add `ry engine restart \u003cengine-id\u003e` to Available Commands section\n- Update 'Stalled Engine' decision rule: after releasing the car, restart the engine (not just mark dead)\n- Add new decision rule 'Stale Car Claim': if car status=done but engine still has it as current_car, clear the claim (`ry car update \u003cid\u003e --assignee \"\"`)\n- Add `ry engine list` and `ry engine restart` to the monitoring loop\n\n### 2. Engine daemon stall recovery (`cmd/ry/engine.go`)\n- In the `outcomeStall` case (line 280), after HandleStall, also clear `eng.CurrentCar` and update the DB so the engine doesn't re-claim the blocked car\n- In `claimOrReclaim()`, add 'blocked' to the statuses that trigger clearing current_car (alongside 'done' and 'cancelled')\n\n### 3. Dispatch prompt (`internal/dispatch/prompt.go`)\n- Add a brief note that engine management (restarts, stall recovery) is yardmaster's responsibility\n- If Dispatch needs an engine restarted, it should message yardmaster rather than using `ry start`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Yardmaster prompt includes `ry engine restart \u003cengine-id\u003e` in available commands\n- [ ] Yardmaster 'Stalled Engine' rule uses restart instead of just marking dead\n- [ ] Yardmaster has 'Stale Car Claim' detection rule\n- [ ] Engine daemon clears current_car after stall outcome (no re-claim loop)\n- [ ] `claimOrReclaim()` treats 'blocked' as a terminal status (clears current_car)\n- [ ] Dispatch prompt notes that engine lifecycle = yardmaster responsibility\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T21:46:51Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-16T22:14:18Z","closed_at":"2026-02-16T22:14:18Z","close_reason":"Implemented .claudeignore in worktrees, fixed stall re-claim loop, added engine restart to yardmaster/dispatch prompts"}

{"id":"railyard-i1i","title":"Bug: Yardmaster detects stalled engines but never restarts them","description":"The yardmaster daemon loop (Phase 2: handleStaleEngines in daemon.go:228-252) detects engines with stale heartbeats (\u003e60s no activity) and reassigns their cars via ReassignCar(), but only marks the engine as dead — it never restarts the engine. Similarly, when yardmaster receives engine-stalled messages from the engine's own stall detector, it just writes a progress note and acks the message without restarting.\n\norchestration.RestartEngine() exists (scale.go:262-299) and correctly kills the old engine, marks it dead, creates a new tmux pane, and starts a replacement engine on the same track. But it's never called from the daemon's stale engine handler.\n\nRoot cause: handleStaleEngines() in daemon.go calls ReassignCar() (which marks engine dead and releases the car) but doesn't call RestartEngine() to spawn a replacement. The engine-stalled inbox handler also doesn't restart.\n\nFix:\n1. Thread configPath into handleStaleEngines() (already available in daemon loop scope since railyard-vxg)\n2. After ReassignCar(), call orchestration.RestartEngine(db, configPath, eng.ID, nil) to spawn a replacement engine on the same track\n3. In the engine-stalled inbox handler (daemon.go processInbox), also call RestartEngine() after writing the progress note\n4. Make restart failures non-fatal (log the error, don't break the daemon loop)\n5. Add a configurable stale threshold (currently hardcoded at 60s in health.go)\n\nKey files:\n- internal/yardmaster/daemon.go — handleStaleEngines(), processInbox engine-stalled case\n- internal/yardmaster/health.go — CheckEngineHealth(), DefaultStaleThreshold\n- internal/orchestration/scale.go — RestartEngine()\n- internal/engine/stall.go — StallDetector (engine-side, sends engine-stalled message)\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- [ ] handleStaleEngines() calls RestartEngine() after reassigning the car\n- [ ] engine-stalled inbox handler also restarts the stalled engine\n- [ ] Restart failures are logged but don't crash the daemon loop\n- [ ] If the engine has no current car (idle stall), still restart it\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass (go test ./...)\n- [ ] Add test covering the restart path in handleStaleEngines","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-17T04:21:29Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-17T04:23:05Z","closed_at":"2026-02-17T04:23:05Z","close_reason":"handleStaleEngines now calls RestartEngine() after reassigning cars. engine-stalled inbox handler also restarts.

{"id":"railyard-oj5","title":"Exclude epic cars from engine claiming — epics are not implementable work","description":"## Problem\n\nThe engine `ClaimCar()` query (`internal/engine/claim.go:36`) and `ReadyCars()` (`internal/car/deps.go:73`) have **no type filter**. They find any car with `status=open` and no unresolved blockers, regardless of type.\n\nThis caused a real issue: a frontend track engine picked up an epic car (the only one in ready status). The epic's subtasks were all blocked on backend track work. The engine spawned a Claude Code session that had nothing actionable to do, leading to a stall.\n\n**Epics are container cars** — they group related work but are not directly implementable. An engine should never claim an epic. Epics should auto-close when all their children are done.\n\n### Root Cause\n`ClaimCar()` query:\n```go\nresult := tx.Where(\"status = ? AND (assignee = ? OR assignee IS NULL) AND track = ?\", \"open\", \"\", track).\n    Where(\"id NOT IN (?)\", blockedSub).\n    Order(\"priority ASC, created_at ASC\").\n    Limit(1).\n    Find(\u0026claimed)\n```\nNo `.Where(\"type != ?\", \"epic\")` clause.\n\nSame for `ReadyCars()`:\n```go\nq := db.Where(\"status = ? AND (assignee = ? OR assignee IS NULL)\", \"open\", \"\").\n    Where(\"id NOT IN (?)\", blockedSub)\n```\n\n### Related Issue\nWhen an engine claims a car whose children are all blocked on another track, it stalls with nothing to do. Beyond filtering epics, consider: should the engine be able to unclaim a car and move on if it detects the work is blocked? (This relates to railyard-f3r stalled engine recovery.)\n\n## Changes Required\n\n### 1. Filter epics from ClaimCar (`internal/engine/claim.go`)\nAdd `.Where(\"type != ?\", \"epic\")` to the claim query so engines never claim epics.\n\n### 2. Filter epics from ReadyCars (`internal/car/deps.go`)\nAdd the same filter to `ReadyCars()` so `ry car ready` doesn't show epics as claimable.\n\n### 3. Auto-close epics when children complete (`internal/yardmaster/switch.go`)\nAfter `UnblockDeps()` in the Switch flow, check if the merged car's parent is an epic and all siblings are done. If so, auto-close the epic.\n\n### 4. Consider spike type\nSpikes (research tasks) ARE implementable — engines should be able to claim them. Only exclude `type=epic`.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `ClaimCar()` never returns a car with type=epic\n- [ ] `ReadyCars()` never returns a car with type=epic  \n- [ ] Add test in `claim_test.go`: epic car with status=open and no deps is NOT claimed\n- [ ] Add test in `deps_test.go`: epic doesn't appear in ReadyCars results\n- [ ] Epic auto-close: when all children of an epic are done, epic status transitions to done\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T21:56:39Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-16T22:09:14Z","closed_at":"2026-02-16T22:09:14Z","close_reason":"Filtered epics from ClaimCar and ReadyCars queries, added TryCloseEpic auto-close after merge, added tests"}

There is no push notification, no terminal alert, no external integration. In practice, the human never sees the escalation unless they're actively polling.\n\n## What's Needed\n\nA notification mechanism that actually reaches the human operator. Options (not mutually exclusive):\n\n### Option A: Terminal notification (minimum viable)\n- When yardmaster sends a message to 'human', write to a visible location: tmux status bar, a dedicated tmux pane, or a desktop notification via `notify-send` / `osascript`\n- Simplest: yardmaster pane prints a prominent banner that the human sees when they check tmux\n- Could also use `tmux display-message` to flash a notification across all panes\n\n### Option B: Webhook integration\n- Add optional `notifications` config section in `railyard.yaml`:\n```yaml\nnotifications:\n  webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/...\n  # or\n  command: \"notify-send 'Railyard' '{{.Subject}}: {{.Body}}'\"\n```\n- When a message targets 'human' or has priority 'urgent', fire the webhook/command\n- Implementation: `internal/messaging/notify.go` with a `Notify()` function called after `Send()`\n\n### Option C: `ry watch` command\n- A blocking command that streams messages to human in real-time\n- `ry watch --agent human` — polls inbox and prints new messages as they arrive\n- Simpler than webhook, works in any terminal\n\n## Suggested Approach\nStart with Option A (tmux display-message) + Option C (`ry watch`). Webhook can come later.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `internal/messaging/send.go` — add notification hook after Send()\n- `internal/config/config.go` — add optional NotificationConfig\n- `internal/orchestration/orchestration.go` — possibly add a notification pane\n- `cmd/ry/` — add `ry watch` command\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] When yardmaster escalates to human, the human gets a visible notification\n- [ ] At minimum: tmux display-message shows the escalation text across the session\n- [ ] `ry watch --agent human` command streams incoming messages in real-time\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass\n- [ ] Optional: webhook/command config in railyard.yaml for external notifications","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T21:56:21Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-17T00:20:40Z","closed_at":"2026-02-17T00:20:40Z","close_reason":"Implemented ry watch command + notification hook in messaging.Send()"}

GORM's `Create()` in `engine.Register()` tries to INSERT into the `overlay_table` column which doesn't exist.\n\n## Root cause\n\n`ry engine start` connects to Dolt (`db.Connect()`) but does NOT run `db.AutoMigrate()` to reconcile the schema. The `ry db init` command does run AutoMigrate, but users don't re-run it after updating the binary.\n\n## Fix\n\nAdd `db.AutoMigrate(gormDB)` in `runEngineStart()` (in `cmd/ry/engine.go`) right after the `db.Connect()` call, before any model operations. GORM's AutoMigrate is idempotent — it only adds missing columns/tables and never drops them, so it's safe to run on every startup.\n\nThis is the same pattern used in `ry db init` and `ry db reset --reinit`.\n\n### Location\n- `cmd/ry/engine.go:83-86` — add `db.AutoMigrate(gormDB)` after `db.Connect()`\n\n## Verification\n1. `go build ./cmd/ry/` compiles\n2. `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 300s -race` passes\n3.
