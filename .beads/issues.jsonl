Options:\n1. Drop the `-p` flag and launch `claude` interactively (user attaches to tmux pane)\n2. Use a CLAUDE.md with the dispatch prompt instead of `--system-prompt` so the session has persistent context\n3.

This confused the agent during a todo app test — it saw the database name and incorporated it into its work instead of building the requested in-memory store.\n\nEngines work in git worktrees (`engines/\u003cengineID\u003e/`) which are checkouts of the same repo, so all repo files including `railyard.yaml` are visible to the Claude Code subprocess.\n\nOther Railyard artifacts that could cause similar confusion:\n- `railyard.yaml` — Dolt DB config, track definitions, stall thresholds\n- `engines/` directory — other engine worktrees (shouldn't be visible, already gitignored?)\n- `.beads/` directory — issue tracking data\n\n## Approach Options\n\n### Option A: .claudeignore in worktree (preferred)\nClaude Code respects `.claudeignore` files (same format as `.gitignore`). Before spawning the agent, the engine could write a `.claudeignore` into the worktree that excludes Railyard files:\n```\nrailyard.yaml\n.beads/\nengines/\n```\nThis is the cleanest solution — the agent never sees the files at all.\n\nImplementation: In `EnsureWorktree()` or `SpawnAgent()` in `internal/engine/git.go` or `internal/engine/subprocess.go`, write the `.claudeignore` file before launching claude.\n\n### Option B: System prompt instruction\nAdd a line to `writeInstructions()` in `internal/engine/context.go` telling the agent to ignore `railyard.yaml`.

{"id":"railyard-f3r","title":"Stalled engine recovery: teach agents ry engine restart and fix stale car claims","description":"## Problem\n\nMultiple issues around stalled engine recovery:\n\n1. **Dispatch used `ry start` to restart a stalled engine** — this starts the full orchestration (Dispatch + Yardmaster + engines) instead of restarting just one engine. Dispatch doesn't know about `ry engine restart \u003cengine-id\u003e`.\n\n2. **Yardmaster prompt doesn't include `ry engine restart`** — the yardmaster prompt (`internal/yardmaster/prompt.go`) has a 'Stalled Engine' decision rule that marks engines dead and releases cars, but never restarts them. The command exists (`orchestration.RestartEngine()`) but yardmaster doesn't know about it.\n\n3. **Stale car claims create re-claim loops** — when HandleStall marks a car as 'blocked' and the engine is still alive, the engine daemon's `claimOrReclaim()` (`cmd/ry/engine.go:339`) re-claims it because 'blocked' != 'done'/'cancelled'. The engine loops trying to work on a blocked car forever.\n\n4. **Done cars stuck as claimed** — if a car reaches status 'done' but the engine's `current_car` field wasn't cleared (e.g., process died between completion and cleanup), yardmaster should detect and clean this up so the engine can move on.\n\n5. **Dispatch shouldn't manage engines directly** — engine lifecycle is yardmaster's job. Dispatch should know to describe the problem and let yardmaster handle it, or at most use `ry engine restart`.\n\n## Changes Required\n\n### 1. Yardmaster prompt (`internal/yardmaster/prompt.go`)\n- Add `ry engine restart \u003cengine-id\u003e` to Available Commands section\n- Update 'Stalled Engine' decision rule: after releasing the car, restart the engine (not just mark dead)\n- Add new decision rule 'Stale Car Claim': if car status=done but engine still has it as current_car, clear the claim (`ry car update \u003cid\u003e --assignee \"\"`)\n- Add `ry engine list` and `ry engine restart` to the monitoring loop\n\n### 2. Engine daemon stall recovery (`cmd/ry/engine.go`)\n- In the `outcomeStall` case (line 280), after HandleStall, also clear `eng.CurrentCar` and update the DB so the engine doesn't re-claim the blocked car\n- In `claimOrReclaim()`, add 'blocked' to the statuses that trigger clearing current_car (alongside 'done' and 'cancelled')\n\n### 3. Dispatch prompt (`internal/dispatch/prompt.go`)\n- Add a brief note that engine management (restarts, stall recovery) is yardmaster's responsibility\n- If Dispatch needs an engine restarted, it should message yardmaster rather than using `ry start`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Yardmaster prompt includes `ry engine restart \u003cengine-id\u003e` in available commands\n- [ ] Yardmaster 'Stalled Engine' rule uses restart instead of just marking dead\n- [ ] Yardmaster has 'Stale Car Claim' detection rule\n- [ ] Engine daemon clears current_car after stall outcome (no re-claim loop)\n- [ ] `claimOrReclaim()` treats 'blocked' as a terminal status (clears current_car)\n- [ ] Dispatch prompt notes that engine lifecycle = yardmaster responsibility\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T21:46:51Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-16T22:14:18Z","closed_at":"2026-02-16T22:14:18Z","close_reason":"Implemented .claudeignore in worktrees, fixed stall re-claim loop, added engine restart to yardmaster/dispatch prompts"}

{"id":"railyard-oj5","title":"Exclude epic cars from engine claiming — epics are not implementable work","description":"## Problem\n\nThe engine `ClaimCar()` query (`internal/engine/claim.go:36`) and `ReadyCars()` (`internal/car/deps.go:73`) have **no type filter**. They find any car with `status=open` and no unresolved blockers, regardless of type.\n\nThis caused a real issue: a frontend track engine picked up an epic car (the only one in ready status). The epic's subtasks were all blocked on backend track work. The engine spawned a Claude Code session that had nothing actionable to do, leading to a stall.\n\n**Epics are container cars** — they group related work but are not directly implementable. An engine should never claim an epic. Epics should auto-close when all their children are done.\n\n### Root Cause\n`ClaimCar()` query:\n```go\nresult := tx.Where(\"status = ? AND (assignee = ? OR assignee IS NULL) AND track = ?\", \"open\", \"\", track).\n    Where(\"id NOT IN (?)\", blockedSub).\n    Order(\"priority ASC, created_at ASC\").\n    Limit(1).\n    Find(\u0026claimed)\n```\nNo `.Where(\"type != ?\", \"epic\")` clause.\n\nSame for `ReadyCars()`:\n```go\nq := db.Where(\"status = ? AND (assignee = ? OR assignee IS NULL)\", \"open\", \"\").\n    Where(\"id NOT IN (?)\", blockedSub)\n```\n\n### Related Issue\nWhen an engine claims a car whose children are all blocked on another track, it stalls with nothing to do. Beyond filtering epics, consider: should the engine be able to unclaim a car and move on if it detects the work is blocked? (This relates to railyard-f3r stalled engine recovery.)\n\n## Changes Required\n\n### 1. Filter epics from ClaimCar (`internal/engine/claim.go`)\nAdd `.Where(\"type != ?\", \"epic\")` to the claim query so engines never claim epics.\n\n### 2. Filter epics from ReadyCars (`internal/car/deps.go`)\nAdd the same filter to `ReadyCars()` so `ry car ready` doesn't show epics as claimable.\n\n### 3. Auto-close epics when children complete (`internal/yardmaster/switch.go`)\nAfter `UnblockDeps()` in the Switch flow, check if the merged car's parent is an epic and all siblings are done. If so, auto-close the epic.\n\n### 4. Consider spike type\nSpikes (research tasks) ARE implementable — engines should be able to claim them. Only exclude `type=epic`.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `ClaimCar()` never returns a car with type=epic\n- [ ] `ReadyCars()` never returns a car with type=epic  \n- [ ] Add test in `claim_test.go`: epic car with status=open and no deps is NOT claimed\n- [ ] Add test in `deps_test.go`: epic doesn't appear in ReadyCars results\n- [ ] Epic auto-close: when all children of an epic are done, epic status transitions to done\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T21:56:39Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-16T22:09:14Z","closed_at":"2026-02-16T22:09:14Z","close_reason":"Filtered epics from ClaimCar and ReadyCars queries, added TryCloseEpic auto-close after merge, added tests"}

Dispatch should see what conventions are configured (e.g., 'framework: Laravel 11', 'style: PSR-12') so it can reference them in car descriptions it generates.\n\n3. **No guidance on car description quality**: Dispatch creates cars but has no explicit rules about what makes a good description. It should be told to include: specific file paths, error handling expectations, test coverage requirements, and references to track conventions.\n\n4. **No bug/spike workflow**: Dispatch only shows epic and task examples. It should know when to create spikes (research unknowns before committing to implementation) and how to create bug cars when the user reports issues.\n\n5. **No awareness of engine capabilities**: Dispatch doesn't know that engines can split work, file bugs, or ask yardmaster for help. This context would help Dispatch create better-scoped cars (not too large, not too small).\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- [ ] Add conventions rendering to the prompt template (iterate .Tracks[].Conventions and display them)\n- [ ] Add test_command to the track info section\n- [ ] Add a 'Writing Good Car Descriptions' section with rules: include file paths, specify test expectations, reference conventions, define edge cases and error handling\n- [ ] Add spike and bug type examples to the decomposition rules\n- [ ] Add a brief note about engine capabilities (can split work, file bugs, message yardmaster) so Dispatch sizes cars appropriately\n- [ ] Update the prompt template test in dispatch_test.go (if exists) or add one verifying conventions appear in output\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T21:05:06Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-16T21:05:06Z"}

{"id":"railyard-s9f","title":"Add real human notification mechanism for escalations","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently yardmaster escalation to humans is just a DB message:\n```\nry message send --from yardmaster --to human --subject \"escalate\" --body \"...\"\n```\n\nThis message sits in the Dolt `messages` table until someone manually runs `ry inbox --agent human`. There is no push notification, no terminal alert, no external integration. In practice, the human never sees the escalation unless they're actively polling.\n\n## What's Needed\n\nA notification mechanism that actually reaches the human operator. Options (not mutually exclusive):\n\n### Option A: Terminal notification (minimum viable)\n- When yardmaster sends a message to 'human', write to a visible location: tmux status bar, a dedicated tmux pane, or a desktop notification via `notify-send` / `osascript`\n- Simplest: yardmaster pane prints a prominent banner that the human sees when they check tmux\n- Could also use `tmux display-message` to flash a notification across all panes\n\n### Option B: Webhook integration\n- Add optional `notifications` config section in `railyard.yaml`:\n```yaml\nnotifications:\n  webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/...\n  # or\n  command: \"notify-send 'Railyard' '{{.Subject}}: {{.Body}}'\"\n```\n- When a message targets 'human' or has priority 'urgent', fire the webhook/command\n- Implementation: `internal/messaging/notify.go` with a `Notify()` function called after `Send()`\n\n### Option C: `ry watch` command\n- A blocking command that streams messages to human in real-time\n- `ry watch --agent human` — polls inbox and prints new messages as they arrive\n- Simpler than webhook, works in any terminal\n\n## Suggested Approach\nStart with Option A (tmux display-message) + Option C (`ry watch`). Webhook can come later.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `internal/messaging/send.go` — add notification hook after Send()\n- `internal/config/config.go` — add optional NotificationConfig\n- `internal/orchestration/orchestration.go` — possibly add a notification pane\n- `cmd/ry/` — add `ry watch` command\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] When yardmaster escalates to human, the human gets a visible notification\n- [ ] At minimum: tmux display-message shows the escalation text across the session\n- [ ] `ry watch --agent human` command streams incoming messages in real-time\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass\n- [ ] Optional: webhook/command config in railyard.yaml for external notifications","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"chris.trower@outlook.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T21:56:21Z","created_by":"Chris Trower","updated_at":"2026-02-17T00:20:40Z","closed_at":"2026-02-17T00:20:40Z","close_reason":"Implemented ry watch command + notification hook in messaging.Send()"}
